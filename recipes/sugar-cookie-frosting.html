    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3><p>This sugar cookie frosting is made with confectioners' sugar and shortening instead of butter so it's less likely to melt. It has a lovely vanilla flavor. It's quick and easy to make and works well on both soft and crisp sugar cookies. It starts out soft and spreadable but firms up nicely for cookie stacking and storage. Divide the frosting into smaller bowls and use food coloring to tint as desired.</p></h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shortening</strong>: This sugar cookie frosting starts with shortening instead of butter. Why? Shortening creates frosting that firms up nicely and is unlikely to melt, which means it's perfect for stacking cookies.</li>
            <li><strong>Confectioners' sugar</strong>: Confectioners' sugar (a.k.a. powdered sugar or icing sugar) is the next ingredient. Don't substitute granulated sugar, as it's not fine enough.</li>
            <li><strong>Milk</strong>: A few tablespoons of milk thins the frosting, making it perfectly spreadable.</li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla</strong>: A teaspoon of vanilla extract enhances the flavor of the sugar cookie frosting. You can substitute almond extract, if desired.</li>
            <li><strong>Food coloring (optional)</strong>: If you need your frosting to be a specific color, use food coloring to create the perfect hue.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Beat the shortening until creamy.</li>
            <li>Gradually beat in the sugar and milk in small amounts, alternating until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add vanilla and continue beating until the frosting is stiff and glossy.</li>
            <li>Stir in the food coloring, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
